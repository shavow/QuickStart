# QuickStart
Quick Start is a application that when run, launches a simple ui which displays other application shortcuts, the shortcuts can be added and removed using the simple ui button functions, Quick Start also acts as a task manager by which navigating to is by pressing a ">" looking button, here in the task manager you can close background processes and windowed applications,

Ui functions (buttons) --

[+] --
the Add button allows you to add shortcuts to the ui listbox by opening an external explorer where you are able to select an exe, which once selected and applied, the application will automatically create a shortcut of that exe and place it inside of a folder which can be accessed by pressing the [O] button, on the other page which displays all the background processes and windowed applications in a listbox, pressing this button will refresh the listbox, updating the active and running processes and applications.

[!]
the Execute button allows you to start the selected shortcut in the ui listbox, for instance, selecting "Google Chrome" in the listbox and pressing the Execute button will open and start Google Chrome, on the other page it does the oposite and will close the application that is selected in the "task manager" listbox.

[-]
the Close button allowed you to delete the selected Shortcut, and on the other page does nothing.

Other Features --
the On Top Button once activated or deactivated, determs if the application will be "ontop" of any other windowed applications. NOT TICKED = not always on top, TICKED = always on top. 

keep in mind when adding a shortcut to Quick Start, make sure the selected file has the extension "*.exe" to avoid any problems.

the [O] button once pressed will open an external explorer, which will automatically be navigated to the folder directory that is used to run Quick Start.

the [X] button once pressed will simply close and stop running Quick Start, the shortcuts will be saved.

#Awareness --
if you think this application may be a thread because its an "unauthorized creator" i will upload the Quick Start python file to the same directory as the Quick Start application,
there you can safe-check the Quick Start application.
